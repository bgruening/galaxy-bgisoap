# Test dataset for SOAPdenovo2

This dataset is used for testing SOAPdenovo2. It contains short sequence reads
which have been generated by simulation from the complete genome of
[phiX174](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001422).

The reads are contained within 3 folders:

* Illumina_90bp_200IS_20X: read length=90bp, insert size=200,  20X 
* Illumina_90bp_500IS_20X: read length=90bp, insert size=500,  20X
* Illumina_90bp_2000IS_10X: read length=90bp, insert size=2000, 10X

## Notice on functional testing

For the functional test in the soapdenovo2_wrapper.xml to run successfully, a
hack is required due to the use of the soap.config file by SOAPdenovo2. The
above files containing the short reads need to be pre-installed on your Galaxy
server and the path to these files added to the soap.config file.
