Test datasets for SOAP
======================

ref.fa
------

A file containing 100001 bp, extracted from chromosome 12 of the human18
genome build.

test_PE1.fa and test_PE2.fa:
----------------------------

Two files containing simulated short sequence reads. Each file contains
71430 simulated reads. The read length is 35 bp and insert size is 
500, with SD 20.

hu18_chr12.fa
-------------

This file is the same dataset as ref.fa but should be used for
generating the 2bwt index files for testing SOAP2.
